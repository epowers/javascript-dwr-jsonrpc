Javascript JSON-RPC and SMD

Features:
* Javascript client centric JSON-RPC.  The client is functional without server-side scripting.
* JSON-RPC Service Mapping Description (SMD) using annotations/decorators for server host languages, currently PHP and Django/Python.
* A very simple Direct Web Remoting capability.  Decorate a server method, client asks for services and receives client-side proxy functions for each server method.

Notes:

* Firebug has a problem with XMLHttpRequest URLs that are empty, replaces the debug script with JSON.  To temp fix this, change the request url in several places from '' to '?'.
* As noted somewhere in the code, most of this was written on an iPad (using Textastic) on the bus.

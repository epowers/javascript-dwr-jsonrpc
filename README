Javascript JSON-RPC and SMD

Javascript client centric JSON-RPC and JSON-RPC Service Mapping Description (SMD) with annotations (decorators) for server host languages (currently PHP and Django/Python).

Notes:

* Firebug has a problem with XMLHttpRequest URLs that are empty, replaces the debug script with JSON.  To temp fix this, change the request url in several places from '' to '?'.
* As noted somewhere in the code, most of this was written on an iPad (using Textastic) on the bus.
